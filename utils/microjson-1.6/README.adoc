= README for microjson =

This is a tiny JSON parser in C that uses only fixed-extent storage.

This code parses the largest subset of JSON that can be unpacked into
static C structures, without using malloc(3). It is very small and
very low-footprint, intended for use in constrained embedded
environments. It may also be of interest for code where malloc is
verboten to reduce reliability and security vulnerabilities.

Apologies about the name collision; I didn't think to check for other
projects with this name when I first created it.

There's a manual page, link:mjson.html[], and a tutorial: link:microjson.html[]
